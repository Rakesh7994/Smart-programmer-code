Usage

1. Connect to Wi-Fi

The ESP8266 will create a hotspot (SmartProgrammer).

Connect to it using default credentials (SSID: SmartProgrammer, Password: 12345678).

Open a browser and go to http://192.168.4.1.



2. Programming EEPROM

Select the EEPROM type.

Choose read or write.

Upload the binary file for writing.



3. Frequency Generator

Set desired frequency.

Click Generate Frequency to generate.
